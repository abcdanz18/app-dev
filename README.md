# **My favorite series**
## My favorite Korean drama series is Hospital Playlist.
### "Hospital Playlist" depicts the stories of doctors, nurses and patients at a hospital. 5 doctors all entered the same medical university in 1999. They are now friends and work together in the same hospital.
### The reason why I love hospital playlist:
1. It's a healing drama
2. The characters are very funny
3. Very heartwarming
4. They have a musical band and they play great music

## This is them:
